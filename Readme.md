# Consumer Protection RAG Assistant

Shopper Ally is a Retrieval-Augmented legal reasoning system built on the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 that provides structured, statute-grounded legal guidance for everyday consumer disputes such as refund denial, defective products, misleading advertisements, online fraud, and service deficiencies.
Unlike generic chatbots, Shopper Ally retrieves official statutory provisions and generates lawyer-grade legal opinions, ensuring accuracy, reliability, and legal grounding.

## Problem Statement
Consumer protection laws are complex and difficult for common citizens to understand.
This project builds an offline, RAG system that retrieves relevant consumer laws
and explains them in simple language.
